# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction Dashboard

This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Business Intelligence & Analytics (BI&A)** to predict three mental health conditions—**Anxiety, Stress, and Depression**—among university students.

A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model is used to power predictions. The web application allows users to assess their mental condition based on input features and displays interactive dashboards to explore both overall and individual mental health trends.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predict **Anxiety**, **Stress**, or **Depression**
